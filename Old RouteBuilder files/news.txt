Welcome to RouteBuilder 1.1.5!

Changes from the last release (1.1):

- point sounds are back
- some small export improvements 
- 3D preview crash fixes 
- corrected tutorial files 
- corrected frensh language file
- missing crack1.b3d file
- awareness of available night versions of objects (objectname.b3d, objectname_night.b3d)
- Change Properties: Form to change fog, speedlimit etc for the world or area
- Track properties dialog non modal
- move everything handles height and scale
- overview map filename and scale can be set in project properties
- bugfix in timetable
- RBAStationsigns can do "hanging" signs
- deleting grid root connection not possible anymore (messagebox, todo: language)
- improved secondary curve export (curve radius = primary radius when parallel)
- undo (Ctl+Z, limited to editor actions like moving, adding, deleting)
- auto-button in Trackdef for max curve radii
- editor and export using alternate curve algorithm (experimental!)
- paste all doesn't paste special track type anymore
- cursor cannot be set at positions x<0 or y<0. Move everything to >0 if needed.
- night export (experimental, and you need objects with night versions, 
  currently there is only one, the misc\lampstand1.b3d)

There are also many new objects in the lib, for example third rail tracks (types ugl and ugr).
Some textures had been in 24bit color depth, this has been changed to 8bit.
To use certain objects (platforms etc), you have to add them to the definition list.
We also added some howto projects. Please have a close look at them. They explain
how to do certain layouts.
Not all language files have been updated. If you want to contribute, contact us.

Remember to visit our forum at bve-tools.com if you have questions.

Have fun.
