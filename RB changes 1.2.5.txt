Changes for RB 1.2.5
--------------------

Global
- Track Height
  track height is now determined by point height.

  if you save a route with heights and load it in older versions the heights will all be set to 0.
  change point height using the new trackbar.
  click the point height info to change it by hand
  point height is saved in mm
  height edit field in track properties deleted
