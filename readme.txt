How to use the incredibly simple program:
(Quickstart guide for the less-technically minded)

Start up the program. Click on "Select Object File..".
In the Open dialog, select the existing object file to add power rails to.
If you enter a new filename, the program should still work, but its generally considered to be strange to create an object with just power rails. 
But, whatever floats ya boat...
Select (or not, if u dont want to) a power rail scheme from the preset configurations list. We have to offer:

Southern 3rd-rail
4-Rail Central Line
4-Rail Northern Line
4-Rail Jubilee Line Extension
4-Rail LU "Others" (East London Line, District Line, Hammersmith & City Line, Metropolitan Line, Piccadilly Line, Victoria Line, Bakerloo Line, 
	Jubilee Line [Stanmore to Charing Cross], Waterloo & City Line)

Then, select the outer power rails you want: Left, Right, none, both, whatever takes your fancy.

Click on "Start". Message pops up to tell you its done.

Not-so-simple stuff:

The program is written to automatically detect the parameters of curves generated by Switch, as long as said curves retain the statistical info
that switch writes in the first 8 lines of the object file. When you load the object file, the program attempts to autodetect the curve paramaters
(curve radius, and turn angle. Note that curves which are not a rail(x) object cause the turn angle to default to 0). If these parameters cannot be
detected, they will default to 0.

In the rail objects pack recently released, the colour scheme for power rails has been darkened, and made uniform between in-tunnel and open-air tracks.
In order to maintain compatibilty, 3 colour schemes are provided, and should be self-explanatory.

Attempting to add rails to straight tracks (i.e. curve radius of 0) has not been tested. 

You *may* find some radii cause the power rails to stop 5 metres short of the near end. Although I have included code to check that this doesnt happen,
I cannot test every possible curve radius in existence. In situations where this does occur, you are advised to adjust your radius slightly until the
desired result is achieved.

This program is provided as is, and with no source-code. This program is not being maintained, or updated, except for circumstances where the author 
feels a significant change has been made. Source code is available on request, but you are requested to provide explanation as to why you want the source
code. No secrecy is intended, im just curious as to why you would need it.
